# Getting Started
* You need to install google cloud sdk which you can do so by following this link: **https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install#deb**
* Once you do that, you also need to create a google cloud service account, and get the .json key.
* I will not be uploading my .json key for **security reasons** 

# Creating the variable
* You need to set the env variable so it points to your .json key
